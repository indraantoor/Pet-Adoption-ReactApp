<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/dM7WC4p/main-page.png" alt="main-page" border="0" />

This is place where people can search for animals to adopt as their pets. Get listings according to the selected animal and the breed.

The listings come up with the name of the animal, their breed and also the place.

Once you select the lucky animal you like, just select the animal and you will get to see more information and photos of it.

This application was built to help myself better understand about React and what it has to offer.
